# tic tac

Straightforward implementation of [Ultimate tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe) using Svelte + Typescript + Vite.

Main goal was to get practice using Typescript and reactivity with something slightly more involved than just a counter. Also did my best to make a super simple UI but with clean animations/indicators to make gameplay easy.
